      mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole determinant of a

      overall health and well-being.

    <h3>What your BMI result means</h3>

    <p>
      A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining
      a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues
      later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet
      with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and
      vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally
      about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

    <h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
    <p>
      Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not
      suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their
      BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial
      to use.

          Gender The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary
          with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when
          evaluating their BMI.

        <h4>Age</h4>
        <p>
          In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI
          to underestimate body fat content.

        <h4>Gender</h4>
        <p>
          BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it
          doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.
