            <p class="app__subtitle-info">
              A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining
              a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues
              later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet
              with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and
              vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally
              about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

              Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not
              suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their
              BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial
              to use.

                Gender The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary
                with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when
                evaluating their BMI.

              <p>
                In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI
                to underestimate body fat content.
